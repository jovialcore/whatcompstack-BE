Having a directory where you can quickly lookup at technologies used by African companies/startups so you can narrow your job search and increase your precision with job hunting or cold emailing is really helpful. WhatCompanyStack is an open source  web application that curates tech stacks used by African startups/companies. It gives a clue into what tech stacks are used in a company for backend, frontend, DevOps, database, etc.
You want to see it as a insightful resource base for your tech research...etc

### Frontend Repo :
Please see our [frontend github repo ](https://github.com/jovialcore/whatcompstack-FE)

### How do we get the information  ?
The project has an admin interface [admin.whatcompanystack.com](https://admin.whatcompanystack.com/not-an-admin). This is where the technological stacks are sourced for. 
We get the information about the tools these companies use from job postings. We scrape these info from online job postings but we also manually do our research and store the information when we have to. 

### Key Features

- **📚 List tech staks used by companies:** You can see a listing of some tech companies/startups with a display of programming languages, frameworks they use. 
- **❄️ **Intuitive Search:** Search feature base on tech stack, programming language, etc ( Frontend )
- ** 🧑‍🍳 **Auto Sourcing Source:** (scrape) programming languages and frameworks of listed companies  (Admin). There is an interace for manual addition of tech tools
- **🔒 Fully open source:** You can self-host the entire stack on your servers. Both the frontend and admin interface is fully open source

### Roadmap Features

1. **Automatic sourcing of information:** While we automatically source (scrape) information at times, we aim to fully automate the sourcing of tech stack information about companies.
2. **Adding a Rating Feature** : We want to display tech stacks base on the one that is most used by a company. All stack are relevant but a stack can be what is powering a major aspect of their system.
3. **Job Posting** : To ease tech job hunting, we aim to provide a feature where we post active jobs for which the companies on our list are hiring.
4. **Stay tuned for more update** : Please sign up on our [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/fc7ca4ca9623/what-company-stack-news-letter) so as not to miss any of these updates. 

Please reach out to any of us on twitter on if you have any feature request.
