### Contribution git flow
To make a pull request, create a branch on the github repo. Typically, the branch name should be the name of the issue you are making a pull request for. If there are no exisiting issues, you should still create a branch and make a pull request to the branch you just created . Please do not make a pull request to dev branch or main.  

Once a pull request has been made, the maintainer will pull that branch and test the recent changes before taking the next action.

- `docker-compose build` to build the container
- `docker-compose run app composer install` to install the PHP packages
- `docker-compose run app npm install` to install the node packages
- `docker-compose run app php artisan migrate` to run the migrations
- `docker-compose run app php artisan db:seed` to seed the database
- `docker-compose up -d app` to start the container
